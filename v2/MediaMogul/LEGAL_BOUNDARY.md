## 1. Executive Summary

This document establishes the **formal legal separation** between:
1. **MediaMogul** (`/CryptArtistStudio/v2/MediaMogul/`): An open-source, GPLv3-licensed video editing and AI copilot engine based directly on **Shotcut Video Editor** and the **Agentic Commander Swarm**.
2. **CryptArtist Studio (The Rest of the Repository)**: A proprietary commercial creative suite governed by a private commercial license.

## 2. MediaMogul Licensing (GPLv3 Compliance)

### 2.1 Shotcut Derivation
Shotcut is an open-source video editor created by Meltytech, LLC, licensed under the **GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3)**. Because MediaMogul:
- Incorporates, adapts, and builds upon Shotcut's QML UI filters, MLT project XML architecture, and video timeline pipeline;
- Directly executes and interfaces with Shotcut binaries (`shotcut.exe`, `melt.exe`, and MLT framework modules);
- Modifies and extends Shotcut filter specifications (`meta.qml`, `ui.qml`, `vui.qml`);

**MediaMogul is licensed in full compliance with the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)**. All source code within `/CryptArtistStudio/v2/MediaMogul/` is subject to the freedoms and obligations of GPLv3.

### 2.2 Right to Modify Shotcut Code
Under the GPLv3 license:
- Any developer or user has the legal right to modify, adapt, rebrand, and distribute Shotcut code and MediaMogul modifications.
- Modified versions must carry prominent notices documenting changes and must remain licensed under GPLv3.

---

## 3. Strict Legal Separation from the Rest of the Repository

### 3.1 Non-Contamination under Section 5 (Aggregates)
Section 5 of the GNU General Public License explicitly states:

> *"A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 'aggregate' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate."*

### 3.2 Arm's-Length Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
MediaMogul is intentionally architected as a **separate, decoupled executable program** (`vibeo_command_center.exe` / `vibeo_agent_center.py`):
1. **No Proprietary Linking**: MediaMogul does **not** statically or dynamically link to any proprietary CryptArtistStudio libraries (`.dll`, `.so`, or compiled Rust crates).
2. **Standard Inter-Process Interfaces**: Communication between MediaMogul and the host CryptArtistStudio suite occurs strictly through arm's-length boundaries:
   - Operating system process execution (`subprocess`, `std::process::Command`);
   - Command-line arguments (`--mlt <path>`, `--action <name>`);
   - Standard input/output streams (stdin/stdout JSON messages);
   - Local filesystem project manifests (`.mlt`, `.edl`, `.CryptArt`, `.json`);
   - HTTP/REST local loopback APIs (`127.0.0.1`).
3. **No Sublicensing of the Host Suite**: Distributing, building, or compiling MediaMogul does **not** convey, license, open-source, or encumber any code, patents, or assets of the private commercial parts of CryptArtistStudio.
